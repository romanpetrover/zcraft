# ZCraft - Encrypted Grid Selection dApp

A privacy-preserving decentralized application that enables users to make private on-chain selections using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Built on Zama's FHEVM protocol, this project demonstrates how blockchain applications can maintain complete data privacy while remaining fully transparent and verifiable.

## üéØ Project Overview

ZCraft is a production-ready implementation of an encrypted grid selection system where users can select cells in a 4√ó4 grid, encrypt their choices using FHE technology, and store the encrypted data on Ethereum's blockchain. The encrypted data remains private and can only be decrypted by the original user, while still being verifiable on-chain.

This project serves as both a demonstration of FHEVM capabilities and a practical template for building privacy-preserving dApps that require confidential user inputs.

## üöÄ Problems Solved

### 1. On-Chain Privacy Paradox
**Problem**: Traditional blockchain applications face a fundamental dilemma - all data stored on-chain is publicly visible, making it impossible to build applications that require user privacy while maintaining transparency.

**Solution**: ZCraft leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption to enable private data storage on public blockchains. Users' selections remain completely confidential while still being verifiable and stored on-chain, solving the privacy-transparency paradox.

### 2. Private Voting and Selection Systems
**Problem**: Implementing fair voting or selection systems on blockchain is challenging because vote visibility before counting can influence outcomes, and traditional solutions require trusted third parties.

**Solution**: This project demonstrates how FHE can be used to build trustless private voting or selection systems where choices remain encrypted until reveal time, with no central authority needed for counting or verification.

### 3. Secure Multi-Party Computation
**Problem**: Many applications require users to submit private data that later needs to be compared or computed against without revealing individual inputs (e.g., sealed-bid auctions, private polls, confidential surveys).

**Solution**: The encrypted grid selection pattern shown in ZCraft can be extended to various secure multi-party computation scenarios where private inputs need to be collected and processed without exposing individual data.

### 4. Developer Accessibility to FHE
**Problem**: Implementing cryptographic solutions like FHE traditionally requires deep expertise in cryptography, making it inaccessible to most blockchain developers.

**Solution**: This project provides a complete, production-ready template with comprehensive documentation, making FHE technology accessible to standard Web3 developers through familiar tools like Hardhat, React, and Ethers.js.

### 5. User Experience in Privacy-Preserving dApps
**Problem**: Privacy-focused applications often sacrifice user experience due to complex cryptographic operations, confusing interfaces, and poor integration with existing wallet infrastructure.

**Solution**: ZCraft demonstrates how to build privacy-preserving applications with excellent UX through modern React patterns, seamless wallet integration via RainbowKit, and clear status feedback during cryptographic operations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Deep Dive

### Smart Contract Architecture

**EncryptedGridSelection.sol** (contracts/EncryptedGridSelection.sol:1-48)

The contract uses three main components:

1. **Storage Mappings**:
   - `_encryptedSelections`: Maps user addresses to encrypted euint16 values
   - `_hasSelection`: Tracks which users have saved selections

2. **Core Functions**:
   - `saveSelection()`: Accepts encrypted input and proof, stores on-chain
   - `getSelection()`: Retrieves encrypted selection for a user
   - `hasSelection()`: Checks if user has saved data

3. **Security Features**:
   - Custom error handling for missing selections
   - Access control via FHE.allow() for proper encryption key management
   - Input validation through FHEVM's proof system

### Frontend Architecture

The React application follows modern best practices:

1. **State Management**:
   - React hooks for local state
   - TanStack Query for server state synchronization
   - Wagmi for blockchain state

2. **Wallet Integration**:
   - RainbowKit provides beautiful wallet UI
   - Wagmi hooks (useAccount, useReadContract) for contract interaction
   - Custom useEthersSigner hook bridges Wagmi to Ethers.js

3. **Encryption Flow**:
   - useZamaInstance hook initializes FHE capabilities
   - Client-side encryption before transaction submission
   - EIP-712 signing for secure decryption authorization

### Data Flow

1. **Encryption & Storage**:
   ```
   User Selection ‚Üí Bitmask Encoding ‚Üí Client Encryption ‚Üí Transaction ‚Üí On-Chain Storage
   ```

2. **Retrieval & Decryption**:
   ```
   Contract Query ‚Üí Encrypted Handle ‚Üí User Signature ‚Üí Relayer Decryption ‚Üí Plain Data
   ```
